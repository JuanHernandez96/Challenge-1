# Code Refactor Starter Code
Going into this repo there was a lot of code that was repetitive and I consolidate it and added new classes to match them up with their respective categories.
Resized header and moved words on the right of the header to the center.
added comments in css to show the new classes go to
added alt tags to pictures for a discription of it
